INTRODUCTION					*root_plugin-introduction*

*root.vim* changes your working directory to your project's root automatically
on file open or manually with the :Root command.

The plugin identifies the root of your project using a known file/directory.
By default it looks for VCS folders such as .git, .hg and .bzr but you can
configure it to look for any number of files or folders that sit in your
project's root.

I wrote this plugin for fun and was heavily inspired by vim-rooter.

==============================================================================
USAGE						    *root_plugin-usage*

Change working directory to 'root'

>
    :Root
<

Note: There's also an 'auto' behavior that's disabled by default. See below.

==============================================================================
OPTIONS					        *root_plugin-options*

The files and folders to look for when finding the root directory. Setting
your own value overwrites the defaults.

>
    " Default
    let g:root#patterns = ['.git', '_darcs', '.hg', '.bzr', '.svn']

    " Overriding the default list
    let g:root#patterns = ['.sass-cache', 'Readme.md', 'gulpfile.coffee']

    " Appending to the existing list.
    let g:root#patterns += ['.sass-cache', 'Readme.md', 'gulpfile.coffee']
<

root.vim supports automatically changing your directory to the project root
on file open. This option is disabled by default and can be enabled by
changing the value to a 1.

>
    " Default
    let g:root#auto = 0
<

When g:root#auto is set to a 1 all files trigger the automatic behavior.
You can restrict this to specific files and extensions using a comma
separated list.

>
    " Limit the automatic behavior to only html/css/js files
    let g:root#autocmd_patterns = "*.html,*.css,*.js"

    " Limit the automatic behavior to files starting with Bob
    let g:root#autocmd_patterns = "Bob*.*"
<

Enable/Disable echoing of the "Directory changed to ~/folder/../..".

>
    " Default
    let g:root#echo = 1
<
